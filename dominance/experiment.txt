The Symmetry Condition states that (a) if both hands of a sign move
independently during their articulation, then (b) both hands must be
specified for the same handshape, the same movement (whether 
46
performed simultaneously or in alternation), and the specifications
for orientation must be either symmetrical or identical.


**The Dominance Condition** states that (a) if the hands of a twohanded sign do not share the same specification for handshape (i.e.,
they are different), then (b) one hand must be passive while the active
hand articulates the movement and (c) the specification of the passive
handshape is restricted to the small set of unmarked handshapes: 
A, S, B, G, C, O.
